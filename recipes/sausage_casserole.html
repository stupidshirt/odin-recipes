        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This casserole is a great grab and go breakfast food, however 
            it works perfectly as a dinner as well (My personal preference). 
            Just cut into squares and serve them hot or cold. Swap regular 
            rotel for hot rotel, mild sausage for spicy, or add a teaspoon 
            or two of Tabasco for a nice kick.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound pork sausage</li>
            <li>8 ounces cream cheese</li>
            <li>1 10 ounce can rotel</li>
            <li> 2 8 ounce cans crescent dinner rolls or crescent dough sheet</li>
            <li>Optional: 2 tsp Tabasco</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375.</li>
            <li>If using crescent rolls: Unroll 1 can of dough into 2 long 
                rectangles. Place in ungreased 13x9-inch (3-quart) glass 
                baking dish; press over bottom and 1/2 inch up sides to 
                form crust. If using dough sheets: Unroll 1 can of dough. 
                Place in ungreased 13x9-inch (3-quart) glass baking dish; 
                press over bottom and 1/2 inch up sides to form crust.</li>
            <li>In 12-inch skillet, cook sausage over medium heat, stirring 
                frequently, until no longer pink. Remove sausage from skillet; 
                discard drippings. To same skillet, add cream cheese. Cook 
                over low heat until melted. Add cooked sausage, rotel, and 
                Tabasco; stir to coat. Spoon evenly over crust in baking dish.</li>
            <li>If using crescent rolls: Unroll second can of dough on work 
                surface. Press to form 13x9-inch rectangle; firmly press 
                perforations to seal. Carefully place over top. If using dough 
                sheets: Unroll second can of dough on work surface. Press to 
                form 13x9-inch rectangle. Carefully place over top.</li>
            <li>Bake 21 to 26 (24 gets perfect crust) minutes or until golden 
                brown. Cool 15 minutes. Cut into small squares.</li>
        </ol>
